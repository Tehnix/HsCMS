# HsCMS
HsCMS is a small blogging platform. It allows you to easily setup and run 
your own blog, by taking care of the administration details and the back-end.

If you want to follow the progress you can check the 
[issues](https://github.com/Tehnix/HsCMS/issues?state=open "HsCMS Issues") 
section of the project.

For any additional information, check out the 
[wiki pages](https://github.com/Tehnix/HsCMS/wiki/_pages "Wiki Pages") 
(although some information is also repeated here in the readme).

Contributions are more than welcome! :)...

#This branch

Currently I'm rewriting the whole application, to use a more recent version of 
yesod. In the meantime, I'll also be rewriting everything else, since I've 
gotten a bit more experience with haskell since I started this project.
